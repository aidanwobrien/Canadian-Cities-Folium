# Canadian-Cities-Folium
A map of cities I've visited and lived in in Canada, created using folium, python and jupyter notebook.

The csv data comes from https://simplemaps.com/data/canada-cities and I added columns to denote if I had lived or visited these cities.

To run on your machine - download csv and alter jupyter notebook code to point to csv file.
