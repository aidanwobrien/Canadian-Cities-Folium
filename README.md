# Canadian-Cities-Folium
A map of cities I've visited and lived in in Canada, created using folium, python, jupytr notebook and deployed locally with Flask.

The csv data comes from https://simplemaps.com/data/canada-cities and I added columns to denote if I had lived or visited these cities.

Folium cannot run interactively on Github, so I plan to deploy the map in a web environment using Heroku or Freeze_Flask in the future. iPyleaflet is probably another good option.
